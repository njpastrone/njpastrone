## Hi, I'm Nicolo Pastrone

Welcome to my GitHub! Recently, I’ve been building data solutions for business analytics and economic research—alongside personal projects like a nutrition tracker. I primarily work in Python (VS Code), use Streamlit for front-end development, and often incorporate AI tools like Claude Code to boost speed and clarity in prototyping.

Many of my recent projects are either under development or built for private organizations and cannot be open-sourced. That said, here are a few public-facing projects I completed during my final year at American University:

### Featured Projects
- **[health-data-analysis-app](https://github.com/njpastrone/health-data-analysis-app)** – Built an interactive Shiny app to explore global health and economic trends using panel regression and World Bank/UN data.
- **[health-expenditure-versus-outcomes](https://github.com/njpastrone/health-expenditure-versus-outcomes)** – Conducted an econometric study in R analyzing the impact of public vs. private health spending across 23 developed countries.

I'm always looking to grow my toolkit and collaborate on meaningful data-driven products—especially at the intersection of tech, research, and social impact. Feel free to connect or reach out!
