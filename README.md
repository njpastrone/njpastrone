## Hi, I'm Nicolo Pastrone

Welcome to my GitHub! Recently, Iâ€™ve been building data solutions for business analytics and economic research - alongside personal projects like a contact management app. I primarily work in Python (VS Code), use Streamlit for front-end development, and often incorporate AI tools like Claude Code to boost efficiency.

Please check out the **[analyzing-capital-flows](https://github.com/njpastrone/analyzing-capital-flows)** repository for an example of my recent professional work as a research assistant, or view the **[kinect app](https://github.com/njpastrone/kinect)** to see one of my personal projects, a contact management app. 

I'm always looking to grow my toolkit and collaborate on meaningful data-driven products - especially at the intersection of tech, research, and social impact. Feel free to connect or reach out!
