## Hi everyone, I'm Nicolo Pastrone!

Welcome to my GitHub. Lately I've been busy working on some data solutions projects for business analytics and research purposes, as well as some personal projects like a nutrition tracker. I've been mostly relying on Python (utilizing VS Code), Streamlit for front-end development, and AI tools like Claude Code to improve my efficiency. These projects were either developed for private organizations and cannot be open-sourced, or are still in development. 

Here's some public projects that I completed in my final year at American University:

### Featured Projects
- ** Project 1
- ** Project 2

I'm currently looking to continue expanding my diverse toolkit and utilize my skillset to build alongside other creatives in an interesting startup project.
